# QGene – Hybrid Classical-Quantum Machine Learning for BRCA Variant Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

QGene is a hybrid machine learning system designed to classify BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations as:

- **Benign (Harmless)**
- **Pathogenic (Disease-causing)**

The system combines:

- Classical Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM)
- Quantum Machine Learning (VQC, QSVM using Qiskit)
- Hybrid Ensemble Modeling

The final goal is to build a research-grade prototype with a web interface for mutation prediction.

## 📊 Week 1 Progress (Completed)

✅ Environment setup (Python 3.12 + Anaconda + VS Code)  
✅ Installed required ML & Quantum libraries  
✅ Downloaded ClinVar dataset  
✅ Filtered BRCA1 & BRCA2 variants  
✅ Cleaned dataset (37,362 variants)  
✅ Created binary classification labels  
✅ Performed exploratory data analysis  
✅ Generated data visualizations  

Dataset is balanced (~49% benign, ~51% pathogenic) with no missing values.
